# C14NPO
Welcome to the README file for our non-profit organization. This README provides essential information about our organization and how to get involved.


## Project Overview
Our mission is to make healthcare more accessible to immigrants. We aim to aid them by giving them adequate information and providing resources that they can utilize.

## Features
Form Validation, user email, responsive layout at multiple breakpoints, and a Spanish version of our site 

## Usage Guide
Our page consists of many pages for users to interact with our team and get involved in our mission. We aim to provide healthcare for immigrants and allow them an avenue into healthcare. We also aim to tackle a lot of the stigmatism that surrounds healthcare as an immigrant and make it more accessible by providing a Spanish version for better user experiences. 

## Programs

We run several programs to achieve our mission. These programs include:

- Program 1: Workshops
